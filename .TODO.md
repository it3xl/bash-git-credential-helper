Possibly we can remove the source bash command from calling "source git-cred.sh".
Then we have to use the export command during credential variables declaration.
But I don't know if all CI engines uses the export all the time during exposing of such variables.


Catch all test outputs to a file. Accept test results if output isn't changed from an etalon version.
	Print tests output at the end.
